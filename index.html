            <h1 style="font-size: 30px; color: crimson;"> Name: Spicy Noodles!</h1>

            Noodles are a type of food made from unleavened dough which is rolled flat and cut, stretched or extruded,
            into long strips or strings. Noodles can be refrigerated for short-term storage or dried and stored for
            future use. Noodles are usually cooked in boiling water, sometimes with cooking oil or salt added.

            <h1 style="font-size: 30px; color: rgb(226, 9, 9);">Name:Dessert</h1> <br>

            Dessert is the sweet course eaten at the end of a meal. The term “dessert” can apply to many confections,
            such as cakes, tarts, cookies, biscuits, gelatins, pastries, ice creams, pies, puddings, custards, and sweet
            soups. Fruit is also commonly found in dessert courses because of its naturally occurring sweetness.
